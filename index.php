                        <h3>WHAT IS ACP?</h3>
                        <p>Academic and Career Planning, or ACP, is a student-driven, adult-supported process in which students create and cultivate their own unique and information-based visions for post secondary success, obtained through self-exploration, career exploration, and the development of career management and planning skills.</p>

                        <h3>WHY ACP?</h3>
                        <p>College and career readiness is much more than academics. Wisconsin graduates must have the knowledge, skills, and habits that will allow them to succeed in the workforce after high school. Wisconsin students should be able to think critically, collaborate, demonstrate leadership, use creativity, accept responsibility, and maintain problem-solving skills throughout their lifetime. Presenters should review the Tony Evers - <em>Value of ACP, Why ACP Matters,</em> and ACP 101 videos at <a class="hvr" href="http://dpi.wi.gov/acp" target="_blank">dpi.wi.gov/acp</a>.</p>

                        <h3>WHAT IS PI 26?</h3>
                        <p>Education for Employment was established in 1985 in response to the growing concern over the number of youth who failed to make a successful transition from school to postsecondary endeavors. s. 121.02 (1)(m), Wis. Stats., states that every school board shall provide access to an Education for Employment program. Chapter PI 26, the administrative rule for this program, was revised and became effective on July 1, 2004.  On June 30, 2013, Wisconsin Statute <a class="hvr" href="http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/115/II/28/59" target="_blank">115.28(59)</a> was signed to require implementation of academic and career planning (ACP) statewide beginning in 2017-18 for pupils enrolled in grades 6 to 12 in a school district.</p>
                        <p>It was determined that rather than creating a new rule addressing ACP, the current PI26 would be updated and revised to include the required ACP components.</p>
