                  Each spring the Intermediate School works with local businesses to organize a fun day for Spartan students to learn about different occupations and career paths. Local professionals bring company vehicles or equipment to showcase for students, and students get the opportunity to speak with employees and business owners.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The district is very appreciative of the efforts local businesses put into this event. Careers on Wheels provides an excellent opportunity for students to learn and get excited about the possibilities for their futures, and it wouldn't be possible without the tremendous support of our community!

                  The Career Readiness Business Tour, open to freshman 
                  students, gives firsthand exposure to potential careers 
                  through tours and presentations on career and apprenticeship 
                  opportunities. Each participating student will visit five 
                  different businesses throughout Kewaunee and Brown counties 
                  over the course of the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Our goal is to change the school experience by exposing the 
                  students to things they otherwise would not do,” says Mike 
                  Snowberry, director of learning services for the 
                  Luxemburg-Casco School District. “The more we let them know 
                  about, and experience, career options, they are better 
                  positioned to know what courses they should take during their 
                  final three years of high school.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “The district feels strongly that it must prepare students to 
                  be college, career and community ready. As part of that, we 
                  believe it is important we provide hands-on, authentic 
                  experiences that provide students with awareness and skills 
                  needed for whatever future pathway they choose. We are 
                  excited to offer this program.”
